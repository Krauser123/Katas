     Reverse Words in a String
Given an input string, reverse all the words. To clarify, input: "Interviews are awesome!" output: "awesome! are Interviews".
    Consider all consecutive non-whitespace characters as individual words. If there are multiple spaces between words reduce them to a single white space. 
    Also remove all leading and trailing whitespaces. So, the output for " CS degree", "CS degree", "CS degree ", or " CS degree " are all the same: "degree CS"
